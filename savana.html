      Savanna, vegetation type that grows under hot, seasonally dry climatic conditions and is characterized by an open tree canopy (i.e., scattered trees) above a continuous tall grass understory (the vegetation layer between the forest canopy and the ground). The largest areas of savanna are found in Africa, South America, Australia, India, Myanmar (Burma)–Thailand region in Asia, and Madagascar.

      Origin
      Savannas arose as rainfall progressively lessened in the edges of the tropics during the Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to the present)—in particular, during the past 25 million years. Grasses, the dominant plants of savannas, appeared only about 50 million years ago, although it is possible that some savanna-like vegetation lacking grasses occurred earlier. The South American fossil record provides evidence of well-developed vegetation, rich in grass and thought to be equivalent to modern savanna, being established by the early Miocene Epoch, about 20 million years ago.
      
      Climates across the world became steadily cooler during that period. Lower ocean surface temperatures reduced water evaporation, which slowed the whole hydrologic cycle, with less cloud formation and precipitation. The vegetation of midlatitude regions, lying between the wet equatorial areas and the moist cool temperate zones, was affected substantially.
      
      The main regions in which savannas emerged in response to that long-term climatic change—tropical America, Africa, South Asia, and Australia—were already separated from each other by ocean barriers by that time. Plant migration across those barriers was inhibited, and the details of the emergence of savannas on each continent varied. In each region different plant and animal species evolved to occupy the new seasonally dry habitats.
      
      In temperate regions, savannas became much more widespread, at the expense of forests, during the long, cool, dry intervals—contemporaneous with the ice ages, or glacial intervals, of the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). Studies of fossilized pollen in sediments from sites in South America, Africa, and Australia provide strong support for this view.</p>

      When human beings (Homo sapiens) first appeared, in Africa, they initially occupied the savanna. Later, as they became more adept at modifying the environment to suit their needs, they spread to Asia, Australia, and the Americas. There their impact on the nature and development of savanna vegetation was superimposed on the natural pattern, adding to the variation seen among savanna types. The savannas of the world currently are undergoing another phase of change as the modern expansion of the human population impinges on the vegetation and fauna.

      Environment
      In general, savannas grow in tropical regions 8° to 20° from the Equator. Conditions are warm to hot in all seasons, but significant rainfall occurs for only a few months each year—about October to March in the Southern Hemisphere and April to September in the Northern Hemisphere. Mean annual precipitation is generally 80 to 150 cm (31 to 59 inches), although in some central continental locations it may be as low as 50 cm (20 inches). The dry season is typically longer than the wet season, but it varies considerably, from 2 to 11 months. Mean monthly temperatures are about 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F) in the dry season and 20 to 30 °C (68 to 86 °F) in the wet season.
      
      Common Wildebeest
      A herd of common wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) migrating across a dusty savanna in Africa. The animal is a keystone species (i.e., a species with a disproportionately large effect on its biological community) in plains and acacia savanna ecosystems from southeastern Africa to central Kenya.
      Savannas may be subdivided into three categories—wet, dry, and thornbush—depending on the length of the dry season. In wet savannas the dry season typically lasts 3 to 5 months, in dry savannas 5 to 7 months, and in thornbush savannas it is even longer. An alternative subdivision recognizes savanna woodland, with trees and shrubs forming a light canopy; tree savanna, with scattered trees and shrubs; shrub savanna, with scattered shrubs; and grass savanna, from which trees and shrubs are generally absent. Other classifications have also been suggested.
      
      In spite of their differences, all savannas share a number of distinguishing structural and functional characteristics. Generally, they are defined as tropical or subtropical vegetation types that have a continuous grass cover occasionally interrupted by trees and shrubs and that are found in areas where bushfires occur and where main growth patterns are closely associated with alternating wet and dry seasons. Savannas can be considered geographic and environmental transition zones between the rainforests of equatorial regions and the deserts of the higher northern and southern latitudes.
      
      The distinction between savannas and other major vegetation types such as tropical deciduous forests (or monsoon forests), scrublands, or grasslands is somewhat arbitrary. The variation from one to another occurs along a continuum, often without distinct boundaries, and the vegetation is dynamic and changeable. The tree component of savannas generally becomes more important as rainfall increases, but other factors such as topography, soil, and grazing intensity all exert influences in complex and variable ways. Dry-season fires, fueled by dried grass, may kill some trees, especially the more-vulnerable young saplings, and, therefore, their severity also greatly affects the nature of savanna vegetation. Because grazing and fire are strongly affected by human activities and have been for thousands of years, humans continue to have a controlling influence on the nature, dynamics, development, structure, and distribution of savannas in many parts of their global range.
      
      Soil fertility is generally rather low in savannas but may show marked small-scale variations. It has been demonstrated in Belize and elsewhere that trees can play a significant role in drawing mineral nutrients up from deeper soil layers. Dead leaves and other tree litter drop to the soil surface near the tree, where they decompose and release nutrients. Soil fertility is thereby greater near trees than in areas between trees.</p>
    <p class = "article">
      An unusually large proportion of dead organic matter—approximately 30 percent—is decomposed through the feeding activities of termites. Thus, a significant proportion of released mineral nutrients may be stored for long periods in termite mounds where they are not readily available to plant roots. In savannas in Thailand it has been shown that soil fertility can be markedly improved by mechanically breaking up termite mounds and spreading the material across the soil surface. In Kenya, old termite mounds, which are raised above the general soil surface, also provide flood-proof sites where trees and shrubs can grow, with grassland between them, forming the so-called termite savanna.

      Termite Mound
      A termite mound in Botswana's Okavango region. Termite mounds are a distinctive feature of many savanna landscapes in both hemispheres, and termites are important decomposers in their ecosystems.
      Soil factors are particularly important in large areas of relatively moist savanna in South America and Africa. Where soils are poor and, especially, in areas prone to waterlogging in the rainy season because of flatness of the ground or a hardpan close to the surface that roots cannot penetrate, tree growth is not vigorous enough for a closed forest to develop. This is true even where the climate appears to be suitable. A more open savanna vegetation is the result.
      
      Biota
      The biota of savannas reflect their derivation from regional biotas; therefore, species vary between regions. The savannas of Asia and tropical America, unlike those of Africa and Australia, are best considered as attenuated rainforests, their natural biotas having strong affinities with those of the wetter environments nearer the Equator in the same regions. Trees in those savannas are usually deciduous, their leaves falling during the dry season. The African savanna biota is fundamentally a grassland assemblage of plants and animals with the addition of scattered trees.
      
      Flora
      Different groups of plants are prominent in the savannas of different regions. Across large parts of the tropical American savannas, the most-common broad-leaved trees are Curatella, locustberries and maricao cimarrons (Byrsonima), and Bowdichia, their place being taken in some seasonally waterlogged sites by the palms Copernica and Mauritia. Grasses include species of cutgrass (Leersia) and bahia grass (Paspalum). In Argentina the most-common woody plant is the bean relative Prosopis.
      
      Vegetation profile of a typical savanna.
      In the drier regions of East Africa, acacias (Acacia) and bushwillows (Combretum) are the most-common savanna trees, with thick-trunked baobabs (Adansonia digitata), sturdy palms (Borassus), or succulent species of spurge (Euphorbia) being conspicuous in some areas. In the drier savannas in particular there is often a wide diversity of spiny shrubs. Among the most-prevalent grasses are species of bluestem (Andropogon), thatching grass (Hyparrhenia), and kangaroo grass (Themeda). In wetter savannas, Brachystegia trees grow above a 3-metre- (10-foot-) tall understory of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum). The most-common West African savanna trees are in the genera Anogeissus, Combretum, and Strychnos.
      
      In India the savanna vegetation of most areas has been extensively altered by human activities, which also have expanded its range. Where least altered, Indian savannas commonly consist of thorny trees of Acacia, Mimosa, and Zizyphus growing over a grass cover consisting mainly of Sehima and Dichanthium, the latter also referred to as bluestem.</p>

At temperate latitudes in Australia the flora of the savanna resembles that of other types of sclerophyllous vegetation (thickened woody plants that have tough leaves with a low moisture content), neither fauna nor flora being of a distinctively savanna type (see temperate forest). Most Australian savanna trees are evergreen, surviving the dry season not by dropping their leaves but by reducing water loss from them. The dominant trees of savannas in Australia and southern New Guinea are various species of Eucalyptus, with Acacia, Bauhinia, screwpine (Pandanus), and other tall shrubs also common. Baobabs (Adansonia gregorii) are the most common and conspicuous savanna trees in parts of northwest Australia. Tall spear grass (Heteropogon) or the shorter kangaroo grass (Themeda) dominates the understory of large areas of moist savanna. The prickly spinifex grasses (Plectrachne, Triodia) are prominent in more-arid regions. Most trees and shrubs of the Australian savanna are markedly sclerophyllous. Small patches of monsoon rainforest and other types of vegetation occur locally within mainly savanna regions, surviving in places that have some degree of protection from the dry-season fires.

Fauna
Savannas provide habitats for a wide array of animals, some of which foster the vegetation through grazing, browsing, pollinating, nutrient cycling, or seed dispersal. Many areas of savanna are managed today to maintain large grazing mammals, such as the native fauna of Africa or the cattle used for commercial production in large areas of Australia and South and Central America. Less spectacular but nevertheless very important are the small invertebrates; for example, grasshoppers and caterpillars are among the chief consumers of the understory foliage, and termites are significant consumers of dead plant matter, including wood.

Perhaps the best-known savanna fauna, because of its large mammals, is that of Africa. These large mammals basically are part of a grassland community, despite the presence of low trees in their environment. Most depend on the grass component of the vegetation for their food either directly, as do the herbivorous buffalo, zebra, gnu, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and antelope, or indirectly, as is true of the carnivores or scavengers that feed primarily on those herbivores. Only a small number, including the giraffe and elephant, rely on foliage or fruit from the often thorny trees.

Large animals are uncommon in Australian savannas and are represented mainly by several species of the family Macropodidae, such as kangaroos and wallabies. However, in that region a wide variety of very large mammals and reptiles became extinct several thousand years ago, after the first arrival of humans. Their place today is taken by animals, both domesticated and feral, that have been introduced by humans: mainly cattle but also horses and, more locally, camels, donkeys, and the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).</p>
