                        Every Sunday, as a collective group, we will go on a tree plantation spree for a few hours. During this time we will plant different types of trees on government-approved lands. The location each time would be different and would be a memorable and satisfying experience for everyone involved. All this while improving our environment and building ourselves a better future.</div>
